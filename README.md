# Brain Contusion
An "almost" fully-functional online Brainfuck interpreter. I say almost because the comma (,) command is not implemented simply because I couldn't be bothered to spend the extra time to do it. My C++ implementation in another repo is fully featured and surprisingly robust.

This is based on React and uses a React + Redux boilerplate that I found online.
